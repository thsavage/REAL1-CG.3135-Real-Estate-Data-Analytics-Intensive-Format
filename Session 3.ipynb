If a linear regression uses a constant (which should be included in practice), the R$^2$ is bounded between 0 and 1.  It measures the share of the variation in $y$ explained by the variation in the features used in a model.  Given this definition, 'bigger is better' is the first place that people go to evaluate the quality of the model, which is unwarranted.  \n",

    "> \"However, it can still be challenging to determine what is a good R$^2$ value, and in general, this will depend on the application.  For instance, in certain problems in physics, we may know that the data truly comes from a linear model with a small residual error.  In this case, we would expect to see an R$^2$ value that is extremely close to 1, and a substantially smaller R$^2$ might indicate serious problems with the experiment in which the data were generated.  On the other hand, in typical application in biology, pyschology, marketing and other domains, the linear model is at best an extremely rough approximation to the data, and residual errors due to other unmeasured factors are often very large.  In this setting, we would expect only a very small proportion of the variance in the response to be explained by the predictor, and an R$^2$ value well below 0.1 might be more realistic.\"  \n",
